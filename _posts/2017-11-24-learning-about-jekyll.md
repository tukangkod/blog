title: Learning about Jekyll
---
1. I've been around [Github](https://github.com) since 2009, used it on and off for my personal projects. Never been too serious on it until this last few year.
2. A *familiarization* with `Markdown` language is quite important if you want to get serious in contributing to public repository. This however, never have been in my skill list, I just know the basic of it.
3. Few years ago, I heard about using Github as a free blog. For me at that time, it was quite a revolutionary. For me the only familiar free blog platform were only [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) and some other less familiar name.
4. **So you telling me, we can use git to create blog** Yes, and it has been a while.
4. **So how they do it?** They just use the git repository as the database of the blog posts.
5. **Wait! are you sure it is safe from poking eye?** To think of it, publishing the content on repository are equivalent with posting to public blog. Really not an issue.
6. I am not sure how many tools currently exist for publishing a blog using git repo, but `Jekyll` definitely one of the oldest I have hear in my bubble.
7. The good thing is I can practice few technical skill in one go: `Markdown`, `Jekyll`, `Git` on `Zsh`. Yep all in one.
8. And capturing daily activities on my Github contribution graph.
9. Did I forgot to tell... my new blog is `Google Analytic` able?
