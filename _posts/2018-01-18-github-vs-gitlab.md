title: github vs gitlab
---
[Github](https://github.com) has been around for almost 10 year and has been _de facto_ for git popularity. Not far behind is a feature-rich [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com), seeking more recognition.

1. I've been use Github for a while, on and off. Mostly for personal project or just to sharpen my skills.
2. I register my account at Gitlab on 2016, right after a friend introduce it to me. Quite fond with the feature that they give in free stack.
3. At work I only have experience with git on Atlassian [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) and Microsoft [TFS](https://www.visualstudio.com/tfs/). They have almost similar feature but heavily favor integration with their existing product.
4. My workplace right now use Github enterprise but unfortunately I couldn't use my personal account. Due to the strange `policy`, the dream to see the Github activity vanish immediately.
5. That mean right now I need to maintain 2 account on Github.
6. Now I have a hard time to choose which one to use more.
