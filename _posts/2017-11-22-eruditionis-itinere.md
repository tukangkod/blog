1. The title literary mean "Learning journey" or I would more prefer as "A journey of learning".
2. So what I have in mind, for this blog is, to start log my journey of learning. On anything that interest me, anything that I found over my day to day, sharing my thought, together with practicing writing in english.
3. I am particularly quite bad at writing my thought. Adding with weak in English, this might give me a platform to practice and improve my writing and english.
4. In long run, I plan to make this practice became habit. I hope this will improve my english together with writing.
5. So let's start the journey.
