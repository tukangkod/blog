title: Embrace it! Here come PHP 7.2
---

1. [PHP](https://secure.php.net/) by the time of this blog post, has been around for 22 good years.
2. I've been using it for the past then years, with a sabbatical gap on 2011 (PHP 5.1-ish) where I try to have more production experience in other language.
3. Since the past 2 year, I am back to use it more seriously on this underrated language. It has been quite number of improvement and I am actually quite impressed with the growth.
4. Mind that when I left, this was when [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is not as popular as now (to my knowledge) and there were close to nothing of what ever bootstrap or composer tool that we have today.
5. As of today, the team expected to release 7.2
6. I will say this is not as revolutionary as PHP 7.0, but based on [publish](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=PHP-7.2-Beta-1) benchmark. It definitely faster than it's predecessor.
7. The update of feature is quite appealing, but one of the most caught my eye were the introduction of `Argon2` for [password hashing](http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php). The only set back is the default hashing algorithm is still `bcrypt`. [Argon2 RFC in 2016](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/argon2_password_hash)
8. Taken note of the [new feature](http://php.net/manual/en/migration72.new-features.php) and [deprecated feature](http://php.net/manual/en/migration72.deprecated.php) of PHP 7.2.
